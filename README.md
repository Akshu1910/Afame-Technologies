# IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION

#Introduction
The Iris Flower Classification project is a machine learning model that classifies iris flowers into one of three species: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica based on their sepal and petal measurements. This dataset is widely used for learning data science concepts and testing classification algorithms.

Dataset Information
Source: Introduced by Ronald Fisher in 1936

Samples: 150 instances (50 samples from each species)

Features:

Sepal Length (cm)
