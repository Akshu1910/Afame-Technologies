IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION
#INTRODUCTION
 The IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION project is a machine learning model that classifies iris flowers into one of three species: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica based on 
 their sepal and petal measurements. This dataset is widely used for learning data science concepts and testing classification algorithms.
 
#DATASET INFORMATION
 1. Source: Introduced by Ronald Fisher in 1936
 2. Samples: 150 instances (50 samples from each species)

 3.Features:
  Sepal Length (cm)
  Sepal Width (cm)
  Petal Length (cm)
  Petal Width (cm)

 4.Target Variable: Species (Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, Iris-virginica)

#PROJECT OBJECTIVE
Develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify iris flowers into their respective species using the given dataset.
LIBRARIES USED
  pandas
  numpy
  seaborn
  matplotlib
  scikit-learn

#STEPS TO RUN THE PROJECT
 1.Clone the Repository / Download the Files
 2.Upload the 'IRIS Flower.csv' dataset in Google Colab
 3.Run the Notebook Step by Step:
    Data Loading and Exploration
    Data Visualization
    Train-Test Split
    Model Training (Logistic Regression)
    Model Evaluation (Accuracy Score, Classification Report, Confusion Matrix)

#HOW TO RUN IN GOOGLE COLAB
 1. Go to Google Colab
 2. Upload the .ipynb notebook file
 3. Upload the 'IRIS Flower.csv' file in the /content/ directory
 4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute the code step by step

#MODEL PERFORMANCE
   Accuracy: Achieved an impressive accuracy of 100% on the test data.
   Metrics Used: Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.

#RESULTS
   The model correctly classifies iris species with high accuracy.
   The confusion matrix visualizes correct and incorrect predictions for better insight.
